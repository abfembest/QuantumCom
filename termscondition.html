        Terms and conditions
The management of quantum has designed a market place where every participant is expected to buy and sell their NFT Grains at their own time but not more than 15 times a month in order to reduce the frequency of visiting the marketplace and reduce abuse of the process.
Also it should be understood that as we can have scarcity of products in a conventional market so also there might arise scenarios of scarcity or abundance of NFTs.  When these  scenarios happen everyone must not fret or raise concerns because it would naturally adjust itself.
Everyone that comes into this program is an NFT-G buyer or seller. Your product is homogenous and it is represented with a QR code. The Grains NFT are priced at $10 per one. 
It must be understood that there are different levels of carrier stages in the Quantum NFT marketplace. These carrier levels have their distinctive amount of NFT-G to be bought and what you as a buyer gets. For every purchase made at a particular carrier level, you are given an extra NFT-G to sell. If you buy an NFT-0G at $10, you would get an extra $10 NFT-G for sale making it 2 NFT. This is where you make profit.
Security wise, it is the work of the management to secure your NFT-G and dashboard from attacks. Also everyone that participates in the market would have to pay rent monthly which shall be used to take care of the security, the staffs that comprises of the support team, management team, technical team and other miscellaneous activities.
In the case of frauds during fund transfer between two participants, the victim is expected to email the support with payment history, name, phone number and Quantum ID. This will help the support to be able to trace where the fault is coming from.
