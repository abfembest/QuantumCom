                        Quantum NFT-G P2P is a marketplace where NFT Grains are sold between and among people.

                        In order to get the best profit from this system you need to buy and sell. You will always receive twice of whatever you buy, so it's important that we understand the dynamics this platform operates on.
                        
                        Presently an NFT-GRAIN cost $20 on the platform and the price may increase later as decided by the community which means more money to be made.
